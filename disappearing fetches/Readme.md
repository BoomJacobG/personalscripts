these are for people that hate bloat 

everytime you run the script it shows the pfetch or screenfetch visual but at the bottom it says "do you want to continue?"
and if you press either Y/N it still uninstalls beacause if it didnt that would defeat the whole purpose i put it there as a buffer so you choose when you want it to go away

side not i made these for fun and they kinda make sense if your a hardcore ANTI bloat huminoid :)

they are both for arch because thats what i use idk if there is going to be any debian or slackware/opensuse ones i mean you could easily create these yourself
